# Ripped360: AI Agent Architecture & Integration Design (Draft 1)

This document outlines the proposed high-level architecture and integration points for the AI agents designed to automate and enhance workflows within the Ripped360 platform. This initial draft focuses on the **Multilingual Content Management AI Agent** and the **Health Safety AI Agent (Supplement Interaction Warning System)**.

## General Architectural Principles

*   **Modularity:** Each AI agent will be designed as a distinct module with clear responsibilities and interfaces.
*   **Scalability:** Architectures will leverage cloud-based services to handle varying loads.
*   **Extensibility:** Designs will allow for future enhancements and integration of new AI capabilities.
*   **Security & Compliance:** For agents handling sensitive data (like the Health Safety Agent), security and compliance (e.g., HIPAA considerations for user health data) will be paramount.
*   **API-Driven:** Interactions between agents, the Ripped360 platform (Glide/Google Sheets), and external services will primarily be API-driven.

## 1. Multilingual Content Management AI Agent

**Goal:** Automate translation, cultural adaptation, and terminology consistency for all platform content across five languages.

```

**Key Components & Integration Points:**

1.  **Trigger Point (Glide App):**
    *   When a user adds a new supplement or medication to their profile/log in the Glide app.
    *   A Glide Custom Action (using JavaScript as per user example) is triggered.
2.  **Interaction Check API Endpoint:**
    *   **Implementation:** Google Cloud Function or Google App Engine service (to handle potentially complex logic and external API calls more robustly than Apps Script alone for this critical function).
    *   **Input:** `UserID`, `newSupplementID`/`newMedicationID`.
    *   **Authentication:** Secure API endpoint (e.g., using API keys or OAuth for Glide backend calls if possible).
3.  **Interaction Check Service (Backend Logic):**
    *   **User Profile Service:**
        *   Retrieves the user's current list of supplements, medications, and relevant health conditions (e.g., from a secure User Data Store like a HIPAA-compliant Firestore or a dedicated Google Sheet if simpler, though security is key).
        *   Retrieves user's preferred language.
    *   **Medical Knowledge Graph/Database:**
        *   **Primary Storage:** Neo4j graph database is ideal for modeling complex relationships between substances. Alternatively, a structured Google Sheet (as per user's example `Interactions` sheet) can serve as an initial version, but Neo4j offers better query performance for interactions.
        *   **Content:** Stores known interactions between supplements, medications, and potentially food items or health conditions. Includes severity, mechanism, evidence level, and multilingual warning templates.
        *   **Data Sources:** Regularly updated from FDA databases, Natural Medicines Database, PubMed API (via a separate batch process or agent).
    *   **Risk Assessment & Warning Generation Engine:**
        *   Queries the Medical Knowledge Graph for interactions between the user's existing substances and the newly added one.
        *   Considers user's health conditions if relevant interaction data exists.
        *   Assigns risk levels (Red, Yellow, Green) based on severity.
    *   **Multilingual Alert Formatter:**
        *   Formats warning messages using pre-defined templates and the user's preferred language (retrieved from User Profile Service).
        *   Uses supplement/medication names in the user's language (from `Supplements` sheet as per user example).
4.  **Interaction Log Service:**
    *   **Implementation:** Logs every interaction check performed, the substances involved, and the outcome (warnings issued, severity) to a dedicated Google Sheet (`InteractionLogs` as per user example) or a more robust logging database.
    *   **Data:** Timestamp, UserID, SupplementID/MedicationID checked, Warning(s) generated.
5.  **Response to Glide App:**
    *   The API endpoint returns a structured JSON response to the Glide Custom Action.
    *   **Content:** `success` (boolean), `hasWarnings` (boolean), `highestSeverity` (String), `warningList` (Array of warning objects with multilingual text, mechanism, etc.), `supplementNames` (as per user example).
6.  **Display in Glide App:**
    *   The Glide Custom Action JavaScript parses the API response.
    *   Displays appropriate alerts/modals (e.g., `runtime.pages.showAlert`) based on `highestSeverity`.
    *   Navigates to an

```

**Key Components & Integration Points:**

1.  **User Data Collection (Ripped360 App & User Data Store):**
    *   **Glide App:** Collects user profile (goals, limitations, preferences), workout history (logged exercises, sets, reps, weight, RPE, completion status), performance metrics, and user feedback (e.g., workout ratings).
    *   **User Data Store:** A secure, scalable database (e.g., Firestore, PostgreSQL) to store this structured user data. Data is synced from Glide (e.g., via Zapier, Google Sheets as an intermediary, or direct API if Glide supports backend data sync for this volume).
2.  **User Profile Analyzer:**
    *   **Implementation:** Scheduled cloud function (e.g., Google Cloud Function) or batch processing job.
    *   **Logic:** Regularly processes raw user data from the User Data Store to extract features for the ML model (e.g., workout frequency, preferred muscle groups, strength progression, common equipment).
3.  **ML Recommendation Engine:**
    *   **Implementation:** TensorFlow or a similar ML framework, potentially hosted on a cloud AI platform (e.g., Google Cloud AI Platform, AWS SageMaker).
    *   **Models:**
        *   **Collaborative Filtering:** Identifies users with similar profiles/behaviors to recommend workouts popular among them.
        *   **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends exercises/workouts based on their attributes (muscle group, difficulty, equipment) and the user's preferences.
        *   **Progressive Overload Logic:** Incorporates rules to gradually increase intensity/volume.
    *   **Training:** Models are periodically retrained using updated user data and feedback.
4.  **Adaptive Difficulty Engine:**
    *   **Logic:** Adjusts recommended workout parameters (sets, reps, weight, rest times) based on user's recent performance, completion rates, and self-reported difficulty.
5.  **Multicultural Exercise Library:**
    *   **Storage:** Database or structured Google Sheet containing exercises with multilingual names, descriptions, instructions, video URLs, equipment alternatives, and cultural variations.
    *   **Integration:** The recommendation engine uses this library to select appropriate exercises and present them in the user's language.
6.  **Recommendation Post-Processor:**
    *   **Logic:** Filters raw recommendations from the ML engine based on user constraints (e.g., available time, selected equipment for the day, injury flags).
    *   Localizes the final recommendation (exercise names, instructions) using the Multicultural Exercise Library.
7.  **Delivery to Ripped360 App:**
    *   Recommendations are made available to the Glide app via a secure API.
    *   Glide displays recommendations on the user's dashboard, in a dedicated "Workouts For You" section, or as smart notifications.

    *   **Trend Analysis Module:** Identifies popular features, common user goals, workout preferences, seasonal trends, etc.
    *   **Effectiveness Measurement Module:** Analyzes correlations between workout types, user characteristics, and goal achievement rates (e.g., "Which workout plans are most effective for weight loss in users aged 30-40?").
    *   **Usage Pattern Module:** Understands how users navigate the app, where they drop off, and which features drive engagement.
5.  **Outputs:**
    *   **Reporting Dashboard:** Internal dashboards (e.g., built with Google Data Studio, Tableau, Power BI) for the Ripped360 team to monitor KPIs and trends.
    *   **Platform Improvement Insights:** Actionable insights to guide feature development, content creation, and UI/UX enhancements.
    *   **Anonymized Insights for Users (Optional):** Potentially share high-level, anonymized community trends with users (e.g., "Most popular workout this week in your region").

This completes the initial architectural design for all five AI agents. The next step will be to model the user flows and agent interactions in more detail.

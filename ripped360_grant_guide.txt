Funding request: $50,000 for development, translation,

Founded in 2019, RippedCity Inc has established roots in Delray
Beach as a fitness apparel company. The Ripped360 platform
represents a natural evolution of our mission to help people
transform their lives through fitness, now making health and wellness
accessible to everyone regardless of language barriers.

Founder's Story
Ripped360 was born from a powerful personal transformation
journey and a partnership forged through shared passion for fitness
and helping others.

Tyrone Hayes: A Transformation Journey
Tyrone Hayes began his fitness journey after struggling with obesity.
Through dedication, sacrifice, and determination, he transformed his
body and life through bodybuilding. This personal transformation
became the foundation of his passion for helping others achieve their
fitness goals.
"My own struggle with weight and the transformation I achieved
showed me that with the right guidance and determination, anyone
can change their life through fitness. But I also recognized that many
people face barriers to accessing quality fitness information,
particularly when it's not available in their primary language." Tyrone Hayes

Duveuil Valcena: Visual Storytelling
Duveuil Valcena brought his expertise as a photographer to the
partnership. His ability to capture and communicate the visual
aspects of fitness transformation complemented Tyrone's personal
experience.
"As a photographer, I've always believed in the power of visual
motivation. When people can see transformation, it becomes more
real and attainable to them. Our partnership combines Tyrone's lived
experience with my visual approach to create a comprehensive fitness
solution." - Duveuil Valcena

Creating RippedCity Inc
In 2019, Tyrone and Duveuil joined forces to establish RippedCity Inc
in Delray Beach, Florida. What began as a fitness apparel brand
quickly grew into a community built around the values of sacrifice
and determination. The company gained a loyal following throughout
Palm Beach County.

Evolution to Ripped360
The concept for Ripped360 emerged from conversations with
community members who struggled with language barriers when
trying to follow fitness programs or understand supplement
information. By creating a multilingual platform that bridges fitness
and healthcare, Tyrone and Duveuil aim to make transformation
accessible to everyone in their diverse community.

Project Description

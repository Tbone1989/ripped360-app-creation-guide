## 4. Resource Requirements (Summary)

As per user's detailed input:
*   **Technical Skills:** Python (intermediate-advanced), Google Sheets API, Google Apps Script, Machine Learning (TensorFlow/similar), NLP, API development, database management (SQL/NoSQL, Graph DB like Neo4j), cloud platform expertise (Google Cloud/AWS/Azure).
*   **External Services & APIs:**
    *   Translation: Azure AI Translator, Google Cloud Translation, DeepL.
    *   Database: MongoDB Atlas, Neo4j, Firestore, or other scalable cloud databases.
    *   Cloud Functions/Serverless: Google Cloud Functions, AWS Lambda.
    *   Communication: SendGrid (email), Twilio (SMS).
    *   Medical Databases: FDA sources, Natural Medicines Database API, PubMed API.
*   **Knowledge Base Development:**
    *   Dedicated effort for researching, compiling, and structuring medical interaction data.
    *   Populating and localizing fitness content (exercises, articles).
    *   Developing and maintaining cultural adaptation guidelines and terminology glossaries.
*   **Team Structure (Conceptual):** While AI can plan, human teams for development, data science, content, and QA will be needed for execution.

## 5. Integration Strategy & Timeline Considerations

*   **API-Driven Architecture:** All agents will expose or consume APIs for interaction with the Ripped360 platform (Glide, Google Sheets backend) and each other.
*   **Glide Integration:** Primarily through Google Sheets as the backend data source, enhanced by Glide Custom Actions calling external API endpoints (hosted on Google Cloud Functions or similar) for real-time agent interactions (e.g., Health Safety warnings).
*   **Google Sheets:** Acts as a central hub for content management, initial data storage for some agents (like interactions, logs), and an intermediary for Glide data sync where direct API integration is complex.
*   **Backend Services:** Critical real-time and complex processing (e.g., ML model serving, advanced interaction checks) will be handled by dedicated backend services, not solely within Apps Script.
*   **Timeline:** The phased roadmap (6+ months for a comprehensive suite of AI agents) aligns with the complexity. Individual agent MVPs might be achievable within 6-12 weeks of focused development each, but parallel work and dependencies need careful management.

## 6. Evaluation Plan - Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

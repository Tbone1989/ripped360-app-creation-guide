# Ripped360: Candidate AI Agent Functions for Workflow Automation

Based on the detailed requirements and vision provided, the following AI agent functions have been identified as candidates for development to automate and enhance the Ripped360 platform workflow:

## 1. Multilingual Content Management AI Agent

*   **Core Function:** Automate the translation, cultural adaptation, and consistent terminology management of all platform content (workout descriptions, exercise instructions, supplement information, UI text, etc.) across the five target languages (English, Spanish, Haitian Creole, Chinese, Japanese).
*   **Key Sub-Functions/Components (as per user input):**
    *   **Translation Automation:** Automatically translate new English content.
    *   **Cultural Adaptation:** Review and modify translations for cultural appropriateness.
    *   **Terminology Consistency:** Maintain a multilingual glossary for health/fitness terms.
    *   **Content Monitoring:** Watch for new content requiring translation (e.g., in Google Sheets).
    *   **Quality Assurance:** Implement confidence scoring and flag translations for human review.

## 2. Health Safety AI Agent (Supplement & Medication Interaction Warning System)

*   **Core Function:** Provide real-time, personalized safety warnings regarding potential interactions between supplements, medications, and user health conditions.
*   **Key Sub-Functions/Components (as per user input):**
    *   **User Health Profile Management:** Securely manage user-specific health data (conditions, current supplements, medications).
    *   **Medical Knowledge Graph Management:** Maintain and query a graph database of substances and known interactions, sourced from medical databases (FDA, Natural Medicines Database, PubMed).
    *   **Real-time Interaction Detection:** Analyze user's current and newly added substances against the knowledge graph.
    *   **Risk Level Assignment:** Categorize interactions by severity (e.g., Red/Yellow/Green).
    *   **Multilingual Alert Generation:** Deliver clear, culturally appropriate warnings in the user's preferred language.
    *   **Interaction Logging:** Log all checks and warnings provided.

## 3. Personalized Workout & Fitness Recommendation AI Agent

*   **Core Function:** Analyze user data (goals, history, performance, preferences, limitations) to generate and adapt personalized workout plans, exercise recommendations, and fitness guidance.
*   **Key Sub-Functions/Components (as per user input):**
    *   **User Profile Analysis:** Collect and interpret user fitness data.
    *   **Machine Learning (ML) Recommendation Model:** Utilize collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to suggest workouts/exercises.
    *   **Adaptive Difficulty Engine:** Adjust workout intensity and implement progressive overload based on user performance and feedback.
    *   **Multicultural Exercise Library Integration:** Ensure recommendations consider localized exercise names, instructions, and culturally appropriate alternatives.
    *   **Schedule Optimization:** Potentially coordinate workout timing with supplement/medication schedules or other user activities.

## 4. User Engagement & Retention AI Agent

*   **Core Function:** Monitor user behavior, identify engagement patterns and churn risks, and implement personalized, multilingual communication strategies to motivate users and encourage platform retention.
*   **Key Sub-Functions/Components (as per user input):**
    *   **Behavior Analysis Engine:** Track usage metrics, segment users, and predict churn.
    *   **Communication Strategy Selector:** Choose optimal engagement approaches and messaging tones based on user segment and cultural background.
    *   **Multilingual Motivation Generator:** Create personalized and culturally relevant motivational messages.
    *   **Re-engagement Campaign Manager:** Implement automated sequences for inactive or at-risk users.

## 5. Health & Fitness Data Analytics AI Agent

*   **Core Function:** Analyze aggregated and anonymized user fitness data to identify trends, measure the effectiveness of different workout approaches, and generate insights for platform improvement and user guidance.
*   **Key Sub-Functions/Components (as per user input):**
    *   **Trend Analysis:** Identify patterns in user fitness data (e.g., popular workouts, common progress plateaus).
    *   **Effectiveness Measurement:** Determine which workouts or plans yield the best results for different user segments or goals.
    *   **Usage Analytics & Reporting:** Generate automated reports on platform metrics, feature usage, and overall user behavior.

This list will serve as the foundation for designing the specific architectures and integration points for each AI agent in the next phase of planning.

# Ripped360 Fitness App: Proposed MVP Scope

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the proposed scope for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Ripped360 fitness application. The MVP will focus on delivering the core functionalities that allow users to start tracking their fitness journey and validate the app's basic premise, aligning with Phase 1 of the implementation timeline described in your provided documents.

The primary goals of this MVP are:
*   To provide essential fitness tracking capabilities.
*   To establish the foundational architecture for future enhancements.
*   To gather early user feedback for iterative development.

## 2. Core User Stories for MVP

*   As a new user, I want to be able to create an account so I can save my fitness data.
*   As a registered user, I want to be able to log in to my account to access my information.
*   As a user, I want to be able to view a list of exercises with basic instructions so I know how to perform them.
*   As a user, I want to be able to create a workout log by selecting exercises and recording my sets, reps, and weight.
*   As a user, I want to be able to view my past workout logs to track my progress.

## 3. Key Features for MVP

Based on the reviewed documents (`rippedcity_fitness_tracker_complete` and `ripped360_grant_guide.pdf`), the following features are proposed for the MVP, primarily reflecting "Phase 1: Foundation Building":

### 3.1. User Account Management
*   **User Registration:** Allow users to sign up using email and password.
*   **User Login:** Secure login for registered users.
*   **Basic User Profile:** Store essential user information (e.g., name). Full profile customization will be a later phase.

### 3.2. Basic Workout Tracking
*   **Manual Workout Logging:** Users can create a new workout session.
*   **Exercise Selection:** Users can select exercises from a predefined library to add to their workout.
*   **Log Sets, Reps, Weight:** For each selected exercise, users can input the number of sets, repetitions per set, and weight lifted.
*   **Workout History:** Users can view a list of their past completed workouts with basic details (date, exercises performed).

### 3.3. Exercise Library (Initial Version)
*   **Predefined List of Exercises:** Include a foundational list of common exercises.
*   **Basic Exercise Details:** For each exercise, display its name and text-based instructions on how to perform it. (Video demonstrations and advanced details like muscle groups targeted will be part of later phases, as per the multi-phase plan).

### 3.4. Language
*   **English Only:** The MVP will be developed with English as the primary language. Multilingual support (Spanish, Haitian Creole, Chinese, Japanese) with cultural adaptations is a key feature for later phases, as outlined in your grant proposal (Phase 2 and 3).

### 3.5. Platform (To be Confirmed)
*   Your documents mention development for both mobile (iOS & Android via React Native) and a web platform (React.js).
*   **Proposal for MVP:** To ensure focused development and faster delivery of the MVP, we recommend selecting **one primary platform to start with** (e.g., Mobile App OR Web App). The other platform can be developed subsequently or in parallel if resources allow. Please confirm your preference.

## 4. Features NOT Included in this MVP (Planned for Future Phases)

To maintain a focused and achievable scope for the MVP, the following features (though crucial for the full vision) will be deferred to later development phases:

*   **Advanced AI Features:** Multi-angle form analysis, intelligent form correction, AI-powered personalized training plans, performance prediction.
*   **Comprehensive Nutrition & Health Integration:** Meal planning, barcode scanning, nutritional analytics, supplement/medication tracking, interaction warnings, healthcare provider data sharing.
*   **Full Multilingual Support & Cultural Adaptation:** Spanish, Haitian Creole, Chinese, Japanese language versions.
*   **Community Features:** Challenges, leaderboards, progress sharing, social interactions.
*   **Device Synchronization:** Integration with fitness wearables (Apple Health, Google Fit, etc.).
*   **Brand Integration:** RippedCity apparel connection, exclusive member benefits (beyond basic app access).
*   **Monetization:** Premium subscription features and payment integration (Stripe).
*   **Advanced Exercise Library Features:** Video demonstrations, detailed muscle group information, alternative exercise suggestions.
*   **Calendar Integration.**
*   **Weather and seasonal activity predictions.**

## 5. Next Steps

1.  **Confirmation of the initial platform** (Mobile or Web).
2.  Selection of the detailed **Technology Stack and Architecture** (Step 003 in our plan).
3.  Design of **Data Models and User Flows** for the MVP features (Step 004).
4.  Creation of a detailed **Project Plan and Timeline** for MVP development (Step 005).

Please review this proposed MVP scope and provide your feedback or approval. Your input on the initial platform choice is particularly important at this stage.

# Ripped360: AI Agent User Flows & Interactions (Draft 1)

This document outlines the user flows and interaction models for the AI agents designed for the Ripped360 platform. It builds upon the previously defined candidate tasks and architectural designs.

## 1. Multilingual Content Management AI Agent

**Goal:** Automate translation, cultural adaptation, and terminology consistency.

**Primary Trigger:** New or updated English content in designated Google Sheets.

**User Flow / Agent Interaction Model:**

1.  **Content Creation/Update (Admin/Content Team):**
    *   An admin or content team member adds new English content (e.g., a new exercise description, workout plan, supplement information, UI string) to a specific column in a designated Google Sheet.
    *   Alternatively, they update existing English content.

2.  **Content Monitoring Service (Automated):**
    *   The service (Google Apps Script trigger or Cloud Function) detects the change in the Google Sheet.
    *   It identifies the `content_id` and the new/updated English text.
    *   It checks if translations for the target languages (ES, HC, ZH, JA) are missing or marked as needing an update.

3.  **Translation & Adaptation Pipeline (Automated Backend Process):**
    *   **Input:** `content_id`, English text.
    *   For each target language:
        *   **a. Primary Translation:** Sends English text to Azure AI Translator API. Receives initial translation.
        *   **b. Backup/Verification (Conditional):** If Azure fails or for critical content, may use Google Cloud Translation or DeepL for verification/alternative.
        *   **c. Cultural Adaptation:** The translated text is processed by the Cultural Adaptation Module. Rules are applied (e.g., measurement conversion, idiom replacement based on a language-specific rule set and dictionary).
        *   **d. Terminology Consistency:** The adapted text is checked against the Terminology Consistency Module (MongoDB/Shared Glossary). Key fitness/health terms are replaced with their approved, consistent translations for that language.
        *   **e. Quality Assurance:** The final translation is assigned a confidence score. If below a threshold, it's flagged for human review in the Google Sheet (e.g., a status column like "Needs Review").

4.  **Content Update (Automated):**
    *   The finalized (or flagged for review) translation is written back to the appropriate language column in the Google Sheet for the corresponding `content_id`.
    *   A timestamp of the translation update is logged.

5.  **Content Display in Glide App (User Interaction):**
    *   A user accesses the Ripped360 Glide app.
    *   The app detects the user's preferred language (from user profile or device settings).
    *   Glide fetches content from Google Sheets (or its synced data source).
    *   Glide displays the content in the user's preferred language by referencing the appropriate language column.
    *   If a translation is missing or flagged for review, it might fall back to English or show a placeholder, depending on the design choice.

**Human Intervention Points:**
*   Initial content creation in English.
*   Reviewing and approving translations flagged by the QA filter.
*   Updating the cultural adaptation rules and terminology glossary.

## 2. Health Safety AI Agent (Supplement & Medication Interaction Warning System)

**Goal:** Provide real-time, personalized safety warnings for supplement/medication interactions.

**Primary Trigger:** User adds a new supplement or medication to their profile/log in the Glide app.

**User Flow / Agent Interaction Model:**

1.  **User Action (Glide App):**
    *   User navigates to the section for logging supplements or medications.
    *   User searches for and selects a supplement/medication OR manually enters a new one.
    *   User confirms they want to add this item to their current list/log.

2.  **Glide Custom Action Trigger (Automated):**
    *   Upon confirmation, a Glide Custom Action is triggered.
    *   The JavaScript in the Custom Action collects `UserID` and the `newSupplementID` (or `newMedicationID`).
    *   It makes an API call to the backend Interaction Check API Endpoint (e.g., a Google Cloud Function).

3.  **Interaction Check Service (Automated Backend Process):**
    *   **a. User Data Retrieval:** The service fetches the user's current list of logged supplements, medications, and relevant pre-existing health conditions (from secure User Data Store). It also gets the user's preferred language.
    *   **b. Interaction Query:** It queries the Medical Knowledge Graph/Database (e.g., Neo4j or the structured Google Sheet) for any known interactions between:
        *   The newly added item and each item in the user's existing list.
        *   Any pairs of items within the user's existing list (if this check isn't done proactively elsewhere).
        *   The newly added item and the user's pre-existing health conditions (if this data is available and modeled in the knowledge graph).
    *   **c. Risk Assessment:** For each potential interaction found, the severity (Red, Yellow, Green), mechanism, and evidence level are retrieved.
    *   **d. Warning Generation:** If interactions are found, the Risk Assessment & Warning Generation Engine compiles a list of warnings.
    *   **e. Multilingual Formatting:** The Multilingual Alert Formatter translates/formats the warning messages, substance names, and mechanisms into the user's preferred language using predefined templates and the supplement/medication name translations.

4.  **Logging (Automated):**
    *   The Interaction Log Service records the check: `UserID`, substances checked, timestamp, and a summary of warnings generated (if any).

5.  **API Response to Glide (Automated):**
    *   The backend API endpoint returns a JSON response to the Glide Custom Action. This includes `hasWarnings`, `highestSeverity`, a `warningList` (with details for each warning in the user's language), and `supplementNames`.

6.  **Display Warning in Glide App (User Interaction):**
    *   The Glide Custom Action JavaScript receives the API response.
    *   **If `hasWarnings` is true:**
        *   It displays an alert modal (e.g., `runtime.pages.showAlert`). The title and message are based on `highestSeverity` and the summary message from the API.
        *   The user can choose to "View Details".
        *   If "View Details" is selected, the app navigates to an "InteractionDetails" screen.
        *   The "InteractionDetails" screen populates the detailed `warningList` (substances involved, specific warning text, mechanism) from the stored API result (e.g., `runtime.storage.get("interactionResult")`).
        *   The user might be required to acknowledge the warning before proceeding with logging the supplement/medication, or the item might be flagged.
    *   **If `hasWarnings` is false:**
        *   A confirmation message like "No interactions detected" or "Safe to Use" is shown.
        *   The supplement/medication is added to the user's log without further interruption.

**Human Intervention Points:**
*   Maintaining and updating the Medical Knowledge Graph with the latest interaction data (requires medical/pharmacological expertise).
*   Reviewing complex or ambiguous interaction scenarios flagged by the system.

I will continue with the user flows for the remaining three AI agents (Personalized Workout Recommendation, User Engagement & Retention, and Health & Fitness Data Analytics) in the next update to this document.



## 3. Personalized Workout & Fitness Recommendation AI Agent

**Goal:** Analyze user data to generate and adapt personalized workout plans, exercise recommendations, and fitness guidance.

**Primary Triggers:**
*   User requests a workout recommendation (e.g., "What should I do today?").
*   Scheduled background process to generate daily/weekly recommendations.
*   Completion of a workout, triggering potential adaptation for future recommendations.

**User Flow / Agent Interaction Model:**

1.  **Data Collection & Synchronization (Ongoing, Automated):**
    *   **Ripped360 App (User Input):** User logs workouts, updates profile (goals, available equipment, time constraints), provides feedback on workouts (e.g., difficulty, enjoyment).
    *   **Data Sync:** This data is regularly synced to a secure User Data Store.

2.  **User Profile Analysis (Scheduled Backend Process):**
    *   The User Profile Analyzer (Cloud Function/Scheduled Job) periodically processes data from the User Data Store.
    *   It extracts features like workout frequency, preferred exercises, strength progression, common equipment used, goal adherence, etc.
    *   This analyzed profile is used by the ML Recommendation Engine.

3.  **Recommendation Request (User-Initiated or System-Initiated):**
    *   **User-Initiated:** User navigates to a "Recommended Workout" section in the Glide app or explicitly requests a recommendation.
    *   **System-Initiated:** A scheduled job triggers the recommendation engine to prepare daily/weekly suggestions for active users.

4.  **ML Recommendation Engine & Adaptive Difficulty (Automated Backend Process):**
    *   **Input:** User ID (for whom the recommendation is being generated).
    *   **a. Feature Retrieval:** Fetches the latest analyzed profile and recent workout history for the user.
    *   **b. Model Prediction:** The ML models (Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering) generate a set of candidate workouts or exercises.
    *   **c. Progressive Overload Application:** Logic is applied to ensure recommendations align with progressive overload principles based on the user's history.
    *   **d. Adaptive Difficulty Adjustment:** The Adaptive Difficulty Engine fine-tunes the intensity, volume, or exercise selection based on recent performance, completion rates, and user feedback.
    *   **e. Constraint Filtering:** The Recommendation Post-Processor filters these candidates based on user-defined constraints (e.g., available time for the session, selected equipment, injury flags).
    *   **f. Localization:** The final set of recommended exercises/workout plan is localized using the Multicultural Exercise Library (names, instructions in user's preferred language).

5.  **Recommendation Delivery (Automated via API to Glide App):**
    *   The personalized and localized workout recommendation (e.g., a full workout template or a list of suggested exercises) is sent to the Glide app via an API.

6.  **Display Recommendation in Glide App (User Interaction):**
    *   **Glide App:**
        *   Displays the recommended workout on the user's dashboard, a dedicated recommendations screen, or as a notification.
        *   User can view the details of the recommended workout (exercises, sets, reps, instructions).
        *   User can choose to "Start this Workout," "Save for Later," or "Not Interested/Suggest Something Else."

7.  **User Feedback & Model Retraining (Ongoing Loop):**
    *   **User Action:** User performs the workout (or not), logs it, and potentially provides explicit feedback (rating, comments).
    *   **Data Collection:** This new data (completion, actual performance, feedback) is synced back to the User Data Store.
    *   **Model Retraining (Scheduled Backend Process):** The ML models are periodically retrained with the latest user data and feedback to improve the quality and relevance of future recommendations.

**Human Intervention Points:**
*   Initial setup and configuration of the ML models and recommendation parameters.
*   Monitoring model performance and triggering retraining or adjustments as needed.
*   Curating and updating the Multicultural Exercise Library.

## 4. User Engagement & Retention AI Agent

**Goal:** Monitor user behavior, identify engagement patterns and churn risks, and implement personalized, multilingual communication strategies.

**Primary Triggers:**
*   Scheduled analysis of user activity data.
*   Specific user behaviors (e.g., prolonged inactivity, broken streak, completion of a significant milestone).

**User Flow / Agent Interaction Model:**

1.  **User Activity Tracking & Data Sync (Ongoing, Automated):**
    *   **Ripped360 App:** Tracks user interactions (app opens, feature usage, workout logging, social interactions, content consumption).
    *   **Data Sync:** Activity data is synced to a User Activity Store.

2.  **Behavior Analysis Engine (Scheduled Backend Process):**
    *   The engine processes data from the User Activity Store.
    *   It calculates engagement metrics (e.g., session frequency, feature usage, workout consistency, streak length).
    *   It identifies patterns indicating declining activity or potential churn risk.

3.  **User Segmentation (Automated):**
    *   Based on the analysis, users are dynamically assigned to segments (e.g., Highly Engaged, Consistent, Casual, At-Risk, Dormant).

4.  **Communication Strategy Selection (Automated):**
    *   For users in specific segments (especially At-Risk or Dormant, or those hitting milestones), the Communication Strategy Selector is triggered.
    *   It chooses an appropriate communication strategy: channel (in-app notification, email, SMS), message type (motivational, reminder, new feature announcement, special offer), and timing.
    *   It considers the user's cultural background and preferred language for tone and content.

5.  **Multilingual Message Generation (Automated):**
    *   The Multilingual Motivation & Message Generator crafts a personalized message using:
        *   Culturally adapted templates for the user's language.
        *   Dynamic content related to the user's goals, recent activity, or the specific trigger (e.g., "Congrats on your 7-day streak!", "We notice you haven't logged a workout in a week, how about trying this new quick routine?").

6.  **Communication Delivery (Automated):**
    *   The Communication Delivery Service sends the message via the selected channel (e.g., Glide API for in-app notification, SendGrid for email, Twilio for SMS).

7.  **User Interaction with Communication (User Action):**
    *   User receives and potentially interacts with the message (e.g., opens the app, clicks a link, completes a suggested action).

8.  **Response Tracking & Campaign Management (Automated):**
    *   The Re-engagement Campaign Manager tracks user responses to communications (e.g., open rates, click-through rates, subsequent app activity).
    *   It manages multi-step re-engagement sequences (e.g., if no response to the first message, send a follow-up after X days).
    *   A/B testing results are used to refine messaging and strategies over time.

**Human Intervention Points:**
*   Defining initial user segments, communication strategies, and message templates.
*   Monitoring the effectiveness of campaigns and making strategic adjustments.
*   Creating content for new feature announcements or special offers used in campaigns.
*   Reviewing and approving new culturally adapted message templates.

## 5. Health & Fitness Data Analytics AI Agent

**Goal:** Analyze aggregated user data to identify trends, measure workout effectiveness, and generate insights for platform improvement.

**Primary Trigger:** Scheduled data processing and analysis jobs.

**User Flow / Agent Interaction Model (Primarily Backend & Internal):**

1.  **Data Aggregation & Anonymization (Scheduled ETL Process):**
    *   An ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process runs regularly.
    *   It extracts data from the User Data Store and User Activity Store.
    *   Data is anonymized (removing all Personally Identifiable Information - PII) and aggregated.
    *   The processed data is loaded into a Data Warehouse (e.g., BigQuery, Redshift).

2.  **Analytics Engine Processing (Scheduled Backend Process):**
    *   The Analytics & Reporting Engine queries the Data Warehouse.
    *   **Trend Analysis Module:** Identifies statistical trends (e.g., most popular exercises by demographic, peak workout times, common user goals).
    *   **Effectiveness Measurement Module:** Analyzes correlations (e.g., which workout plans show higher completion rates or better goal achievement for specific user segments).
    *   **Usage Pattern Module:** Understands user navigation paths, feature adoption rates, and points of friction in the app.

3.  **Insight Generation & Reporting (Automated):**
    *   The engine generates reports, dashboards, and summaries of the findings.

4.  **Internal Review & Action (Ripped360 Team):**
    *   The Ripped360 product/data team reviews the generated reports and dashboards (e.g., via Google Data Studio, Tableau).
    *   They use these insights to:
        *   Make data-driven decisions for platform improvements (new features, UI/UX changes).
        *   Refine content strategy (e.g., create more educational content around popular or challenging topics).
        *   Optimize AI agent performance (e.g., adjust recommendation algorithms based on effectiveness insights).

5.  **Feedback to Users (Optional, Curated):**
    *   Anonymized, high-level community trends or insights might be curated and shared with users within the app (e.g., "This week, 70% of Ripped360 users in your region focused on strength training!"). This is a product decision.

**Human Intervention Points:**
*   Defining the metrics, KPIs, and types of analyses to be performed.
*   Setting up and maintaining the ETL processes and data warehouse.
*   Interpreting the generated insights and translating them into actionable product strategies.
*   Ensuring data privacy and anonymization techniques are robust and compliant.

This completes the draft of user flows and interactions for all five AI agents. The next step will be to develop the implementation and evaluation plan.
